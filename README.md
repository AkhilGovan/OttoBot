Hi guys! Welcome to the coding section of OttoBots!

This repo covers the code behind the ottobot, some possible errors that may occur when uploading code to the ottobot and how to modify the code to personalise your Otto!

The main files we will be using are calibration.ino and allmoves.ino. Calibration.ino contains the main setup and loop functions which we upload to the otto. allmoves.ino contains a plethora of otto functions that I demonstrate later.

# 1. Setting up the IDE 
Once you have downloaded the [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software), open the calibration.ino file.
